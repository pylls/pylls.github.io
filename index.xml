      <description>DAITA v1 and v2 defenses At the time of writing, Mullvad is transitioning DAITA from v1 to v2. All latest platform releases are now fully supporting v2. Besides some UX improvements to the Mullvad VPN app, defense updates are mostly transparent to users. It should lead to significantly better performance, especially on mobile.&#xA;I collaborate closely with Mullvad on DAITA. This blog post shares some details on how DAITA v1 works and what is new in v2.</description>

      <description>Evaluating using the first eight DAITA servers About a month ago Mullvad released Defense against AI-guided Traffic Analysis (DAITA) for their Windows client. In summary, DAITA consists of three components: the traffic analysis defense framework Maybenot, tailored defenses implemented in Maybenot, and (significant) integration efforts of Maybenot into Mullvad VPN&amp;rsquo;s stack.&#xA;DAITA = Maybenot + custom defenses + Mullvad VPN integration&#xA;I have been working with Mullvad on DAITA for a while, focusing on Maybenot and defense tooling.</description>
